                                  Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is used in client-server communication. 
the clint can use HTTP protcol to send the request to the serverand the server sends it's response to the clint's request.

There are two stages of http development that we need to focus on.
1.HTTP1.1
2.HTTP2

The difference between the both HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.

1) HTTP1.1 works on the textual format,	
   HTTP2 works on the binary protocol.

2) There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources,
   HTTP2 allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

3) HTTP1.1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages,	
   HTTP2 uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages. 

4) HTTP1.1 compresses data by itself.
   HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
