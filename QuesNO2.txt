     In JS, Object is most important data-type.Object can create the building blocks for
 modern JavaScript. Objects are morecomplex. Objects consist of an Key and value like
("Key : Value" pair). These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods,
 respectively, in the context of an object.

1) By object literal,
2) By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword).

Syntaxt to create a Object,
 
1) this is like Object Literal

  key : "value"
};

2) istance of creating the object directly
  
let Object = new task();

by using the .dot or  operator, you can access the values and keys 
that are present in the Object.
